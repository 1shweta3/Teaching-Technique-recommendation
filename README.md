Machine Learning Project: Teaching Technique Recommender with Streamlit Interface
Overview
This machine learning project aims to provide a user-friendly interface for suggesting the most appropriate teaching technique based on three input parameters: age of the students, their intellectual ability, and the topic to be taught. The project leverages the Multinomial Naive Bayes theorem  and Natural language processing for predictions  and integrates a web interface using the Streamlit Python library.

Dataset
The dataset used for training and testing the model should include the following features:

Age of Students: Approximate age group of targeted audience(e.g., Low ,Medium,High).
Intellectual Ability: Categorical values indicating the intellectual ability of students (e.g., Low, Medium, High).
Topic: Categorical values representing the topic to be taught.
The dataset should also include a target variable, which is the teaching technique that was actually used for each instance.

Dependencies
Make sure you have the following dependencies installed before running the project:

Python 3.x
NumPy
Pandas
Scikit-learn
Streamlit
You can install these dependencies using the following command:

bash
Copy code
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn streamlit
Usage
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/1shweta3/teaching-technique-recommender.git
Navigate to the project directory:

bash
Copy code
cd teaching-technique-recommender
Prepare your dataset:

Ensure that your dataset is formatted correctly with the required features and target variable. Place the dataset file in the data/ directory.

Run the Streamlit app:

bash
Copy code
streamlit run app.py
This command will launch a local web server, and you can access the app in your web browser at http://localhost:8501. Follow the instructions on the web interface to input student information and receive teaching technique recommendations.

Model Evaluation
The project evaluates the model's performance using standard metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. These metrics are crucial for assessing the effectiveness of the teaching technique recommendation system.

Web Interface Features
User-friendly form for inputting student details.
Real-time predictions and recommendations displayed on the web interface.
Clear and intuitive design for ease of use.
Future Improvements
Explore options for deploying the Streamlit app on cloud platforms.
Incorporate user feedback for continuous improvement.
Extend the model to handle more complex scenarios and additional features.
Feel free to contribute to the project, open issues, or suggest improvements. Happy coding and teaching! ðŸ“šâœ¨
